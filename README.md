Dragons will unleash devastating fire from their mouths, engulfing everything in their path.

## AimOffsets

Players riding on the back of the dragon can use their weapons to shoot enemies. This feature allows them to maintain their aiming angle even as the dragon flies up and down, dynamically changing its position and rotation.

## Auto-aiming reticle

Within a designated area, the reticle will automatically track enemies. Players wonâ€™t have to worry about aiming errors caused by camera angle issues.
